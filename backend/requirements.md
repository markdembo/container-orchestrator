**Use Case**
We are building a demo to showcase how quick containers can be allocated when needed, while scaling down.
We are focusing on keeping track of containers, keeping an active pool of pre-warmed instances that are immediately available for users to allocate. When containers are allocated/deallocated we adjust the total instances to maintain a sufficient, but not wasteful pool of pre-warmed instances.

## System Overview
The system will manage a dynamic pool of container instances, ensuring quick allocation while maintaining resource efficiency through intelligent scaling.

## Server Layer Requirements

### Container Management
- Maintain state of all container instances including:
  - Unique container ID
  - Session ID (null if unallocated)
  - IPv6 address
  - Health status
  - Creation timestamp
  - Last activity timestamp

### Event Logging
- Track all container lifecycle events:
  - Container creation
  - Container allocation
  - Container deallocation
  - Container health status changes
  - Container termination

### Core Functions
1. Container Initialization
   - Create new container instances
   - Configure networking
   - Set up health monitoring
   - Add to available pool

2. Container Allocation
   - Assign container to requesting user
   - Update container state
   - Log allocation event
   - Return container details to user

3. Container Deallocation
   - Release container from user
   - Reset container state
   - Log deallocation event
   - Return container to pool or terminate based on pool size

4. Pool Management
   - Monitor pool size
   - Scale up/down based on demand
   - Maintain minimum pool size
   - Implement maximum pool size limit
   - Health check and cleanup of unhealthy instances

## Frontend Requirements

### User Interface
1. Dashboard
   - Real-time display of container pool status
   - Active container count
   - Available container count
   - System health metrics

2. Container Management
   - Request new container allocation
   - View allocated container details
   - Release container
   - View container status

3. Monitoring
   - Real-time updates of container states
   - Event log viewer
   - System metrics visualization
   - Health status indicators

### User Experience
- Responsive design
- Real-time updates
- Clear status indicators
- Intuitive container management controls
- Error handling and user feedback

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Container allocation time < 1 second
- Real-time state updates
- Efficient resource utilization
- Scalable architecture
